## Colleborative and Content based filtering in recommender systems

**1. Colleborative Filtering:**

    - Recommender systems built upon colleborative filtering uses the preferences and opinions of 
         other users with similar preferences and opinions as the target user to recommend new things.

**2. Content Based Filtering**

    - This technique attempts to figure out the user's favourite aspects of an item, and then 
       recommend items that present those aspects. 
    - In this case, given a dataset of movie genres and ratings we're going to try to figure 
       out the target's favorite genres from the movies and ratings given by this user before.
